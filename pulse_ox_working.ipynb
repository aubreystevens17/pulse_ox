    "In my design of the pulse ox, I had several main objectives. I primarily focused on producing clear, accurate data and creating an interactive, user friendly interface. In order to calculate both the pulse rate and SpO2, the AC and DC data from both the IR and Red wavelengths needed to be collected. Thus, I would need to read in four separate signals with clearly distinguishable peaks. To produce distinguishable peaks, values from the sensor probe needed to be read out consistently, with little noise, and a strong signal. Additionally, the signal needed to be an entirely positive voltage for Arduino to properly collect it.\n",

I also wanted it to display the current pulse rate and SpO2 information, updating them as the pulse changed. However, I also wanted to ensure the pulse rate and SpO2 were only changing periodically to ensure the user could easily read the data. I wanted to build in buttons to stream the pulse rate, reset the values, save the data, and shutdown the app, as these all seemed like widgets that would be useful to a user. Additionally, I wanted to create plots to show the updating pulse rates and SpO2 data and show how they correspond to the peaks they're calculated from. Overall, I wanted to produce an accurate app that displays lots of data."

    "Since only either the IR or red light can be emitted and detected at once, this meant that I needed to alternate which light was emitting from the LEDs. Thus, I connected pins 2 and 3 of the sensor probe to digital pins, so I could vary the voltages to alternate which light is on. We were told that the when the LEDs receive +5V, the red light is on, while when the LEDs receive -5V, the IR light is on. Whether the voltage is positive or negative is simply a denotation of which direction the current is flowing in. Thus, if we change the direction of the current, we change the sign of the voltage. Together, sensor pins 2 and 3 complete a circuit, as given in the pulse ox background. Since they complete a circuit, I only need to include 1 220 $\\Omega$ resistor, as it will affect both pins 2 and 3 regardless of which pin it is connected to. As mentioned on the course website, the Red wavelength is active when +5V is flowing through the circuit, which is defined as when pin 3 of the sensor probe is on (at +5V) and pin 2 is grounded (at 0V). IR is active when -5V is flowing through the circuit, which is defined as when pin 3 of the sensor probe is grounded and pin 2 is at +5V. Thus, alternating between these voltages for the two pins allows me to switch between turning on the IR and Red wavelength light.\n",

    "I set up pins 5, 7, and 9 as suggested in the pulse ox background. Pin 7 is a shield, which needs to be grounded, while pins 5 and 9 make up the circuit for the photodiode. While we're varying which pins are power and ground for pins 2 and 3, we want the photodiode anode to be on all the time, as it is what senses both the IR and red wavelengths. Thus, regardless of which light is on, we want the photodiode to remain in the same on state. Pin 5 is the photodiode anode, which I connected to ground as shown. Pin 9 is the photodiode cathode, which I connected to 5V through a 330 k$\\Omega$ resistor. Additionally, this is where I read out the raw voltage from the sensor, as the photodiode has varying resistance based on the light it senses. Using $V = IR$ for a circuit in series, as the photodiode circuit, where the total voltage is described by $V_t = IR_t$, the voltage over the 330 k $\\Omega$ resistor is described by $V_1 = IR_1$, and the voltage over the photodiode is described by $V_2=IR_2$, we get $(V_1 + V_2) = I (R_1 + R_2)$ or $V_1 = I(R_1+R_2)-V_2$. Thus, any change to the resistance of the photodiode would result in a change to the voltage over the first resistor, which we can measure.\n",

    "To ensure that I was accurately collecting data from the sensor probe, I decided to create a sample-and-hold circuit for both the IR and Red wavelengths. These had to be created separately, as the IR and Red data can only be collected at times when the other is not being collected. Thus, I need the IR sample-and-hold circuit to be inactive and when the red sample-and-hold circuit is active and vice versa. This allows me to collect the IR and red wavelength data separately from one another.\n",

The switch is closed (on) when the logic pin has a higher voltage than the input, meaning that I want the logic pin to be 5V when I want the sample-and-hold to be on and 0V when off. Thus, I connected them to digital pins 2 and 3 of my Arduino, the same digital pins I was using to alternate which light source was on. \n",

Building a low-pass filter would allow me to filter out a lot of the high frequency noise in the data. I decided to filter out all frequencies above 5 Hz or about 300 bpm, which is a much higher heart rate than any human should have. I chose to actively filter using a Sallen-Key low-pass filter, as it would remove more noise than a passive filter. To calculate the values for the capacitors and resistors I would use, I used the approximation:\n",

Since the most we can solve for is a relationship between R and C, I simply plugged in different capacitances we had in the lab until I got a convenient resistance value (again, ones that were in the lab). I initially used 1 uF capacitors and 33 k $\\Omega$ resistors for both the IR and Red low-pass filters, but it let too much noise through in the IR data. Thus, for the IR data, I ended up using a 0.1 uF capacitor and a 330 k$\\Omega$ resistor. This appeared to filter out much of the undesired noise. The Red wavelength data seemed fine with the 0.1 uF capacitor, so I kept it.\n",

    "I used 0.5 Hz as my cutoff frequency, as it corresponds to about 30 bpm, which is a very low heartrate. Following the methods described in the low-pass filter, I calculated a capacitance of 1 uF and a resistance of 330 k $\\Omega$. This appeared to filter out my low frequency noise quite well. This time, I designated Z1 and Z2 as capacitors and Z3 and Z4 as resistors in the diagram above. After this filtering, my data was very faint and needed to be amplified.\n",

I initially wasn't sure how much I would need to amplify my signal and played around with the values of my resistors until my data seemed to be amplified to a good level. When trying to find a good level of amplification, I was looking for clear, distinct peaks that took up about half of the range from 0 to 5V. I figured this would be a good amplitude for my peaks, as they were clear and easily distinguishable without any concern of going out of range. I ended up using resistor values of 15 $\\Omega$ and 220 $\\Omega$ for the IR pathway and 4.7 $\\Omega$ and 220 $\\Omega$ for the red pathway.\n",

I wasn't sure how much I needed to weight my inputs or by how much I needed to alter my data, so I played with the values of the resistors again.\n",

    "In my summing amplifier, I fed my data from the amplifier through a resistor into the input of the summing amplifier along with a voltage of 5V through another resistor. I used 5 V since 5V is the maximum value the Arduino can read in. I swapped out the resistor for the 5V and adjusted the resistor for the data from the amplifier until none of my data was going below 0. For the IR pathway, I ended up using resistor values of 1.2 k $\\Omega$ for the voltage from the amplifier, 7.5 k $\\Omega$ for the 5V, and two 1 k $\\Omega$ resistors for R3 and R4. For the red pathway, I used 10 k $\\Omega$ resistors for R1 (from the amplifier), R3, and R4 and a 110 $\\Omega$ resistor for the 5 V path.\n",

I used the `light_count` variable (how many times `printVoltage()` has looped) to keep track of whether I'm going to turn on the IR or red LED and collect data from it. Since each of them takes 10 ms, this ensures that only one of them is on at a time. Thus, when `light_count` is even, I turn on the Red wavelength pathway and when it is odd, I turn on the IR pathway. Then, I collect the voltages for both AC and DC for either IR or Red using 1 `analogRead()` and I write out the values of the digital pins (high or low) using `digtialWrite()`. Lastly, I print out all of the AC and DC voltages to the Serial moniter for both IR and red, regardless of if they've been updated, as the last value they're stored as is the last update. This allows the values to be read into Python for use in the Bokeh app. The function returns the time the data was acquired to be used to determine when to collect the next data point.\n",

    "### Python Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "The general code I used was a modified version of the code in lesson 16. I chose this method of streaming and displaying my data, as it would allow me to display real time updates in the detected heart rate. It also allowed me to build a user interface with various widgets for the user to stream data, clear the data, save the data, and shut down the app. However, I did end up making quite a few modifications to the code. These modifications allowed me to read in all four of the voltages, calculate the heartrate and SpO2 in real time, and display them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Streaming Data:**\n",
    "\\\n",
    "To stream in the data, I used the code from lesson 16 with some modifications. From the lesson, the provided code sets up a serial connection between Python and Arduino. This allows Python to read out data from Arduino. This data is then streamed in upon request to Python and plotted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I needed the AC and DC data from both the IR and Red wavelengths to calculate the SpO2, I needed to read in the four voltages. I modified the code to read in these four voltages. Since IR the IR data corresponds most accurately to the actual pulse rate, I chose to only stream the IR AC voltage on the plot. The AC voltage had been fully filtered and amplified, making it the most accurate representation of the pulse. Since the DC data was collected for the SpO2 calculation, I chose not to display it, as the pulses weren't very apparent in the data. Since the IR and Red data alternate, and the IR data is what is being used to calculate the pulse rate, I figured it would be confusing to display both. Thus, I chose to only display the data the pulse was being computed based on, the IR AC data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pulse Rate**\n",
    "\\\n",
    "I wrote a function, `pulse_rate()` to compute the pulse rate from the IR AC data. It takes an input of the data being used to compute the pulse rate, and `time_bet_peaks` in as arguments. `time_bet_peaks` is the minimum length of time in seconds that is allowed between peaks in the data, which was created upon having an issue with computing too fast of a pulse. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two peaks in each pulsation. This is a result of the opening and closing of different valves in the heart to pump blood. This results in variations in the movement of blood in the body. There are two cycles of valves opening and closing for each pump, resulting in the first large peak, followed by a second, smaller peak. This can be seen in the IR AC data. However, this presents a problem in finding the peaks of the data, as `scipy.signal.find_peaks()` was detecing both the first and second peak of the data. However, upon talking to Heather, she suggested using the parameter, `width` to ensure only peaks a certain distance from each other were collected. Since the first larger peak and the second smaller peak happen in relatively quick succession, while distinct pulses usually have some separation in time, if I ensured the minimum width was less than the possible time between two pulses but greater than the time between the between the first large peak and second smaller peak in each pulse. \n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to make this an input that could be changed based on the dataset. Thus, I made it an argument in the function, `time_bet_peaks`. Then, I convert this variable into a usable width within the `scipy.signal.find_peaks()`, as the width it uses is in terms of the IR AC dataset and is therefore the indices of the datapoints. Since I used a 10 ms delay, these datapoints were each collected 10 ms apart from one another. Thus, I convert the width from seconds into how many datapoints apart the peaks are. First, I convert `time_bet_peaks` into milliseconds by multiplying it by 1000. Then, I divide it by 10, since each data point was taken 10 ms apart. This gives the minimum width in terms of the number of datapoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I created an array of the times that correspond to each datapoint from the same data dictionary. `scipy.signal.find_peaks()` returns an index of where the peaks were found, which I could use to find the corresponding times. I used `np.take()` to extract the times corresponding to the peaks and used `np.diff()` to compute the time between peaks. Then, I took the mean of these values to find the average time between peaks and divided this by 1000, to convert from milliseconds to seconds. the current number I had was in seconds per peak (or seconds per beat), so I needed to take 1 / this value to convert to beats per second. Then, I multiplied this number by 60 to get beats per minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SpO2**\n",
    "\\\n",
    "To compute the SpO2, I wrote two functions, `mod_ratio()` and `SpO2()`. The first function computes the modulation ratio, R using the approximation given in the pulse ox background, $R = \\frac{AC_1/DC_1}{AC_2/DC_2}$, where the subscript 1 refers to the red wavelength data and subscript 2 refers to the IR wavelength data. \n",
    "\n",
    "`mod_ratio()` takes in inputs of a dictionary `data`, a numpy array of `peaks_940`, which are the indices at which the peaks of the IR AC data are found, which were calculated in `pulse_rate()`, and the `time_bet_peaks`, which is the same variable that is described in the pulse rate function. I used these peaks for the AC data in my calculation for the IR portion of the modulation ratio. Then, I also found the peaks of the red AC data. Since the IR and red data were collected at different times from one another, I wanted to independently find the peaks of the red data. Then, I took the values from the peak indices using `np.take()`. Since the IR and red data could have different numbers of peaks, I independently calculated the numerator and denominator of the modulation ratio and took the mean of the data both the numerator and denominator before returning the final modulation ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SpO2()` takes in the arguments of the data in the form of a dictionary, along with a numpy array of the IR AC peaks and the `time_bet_peaks` that will be fed into the `mod_ratiio()` function. Then, I called the `mod_ratio()` function to determine the modulation ratio. I then defined the extinction coefficents (data from https://omlc.org/spectra/hemoglobin/summary.html) and computed the SpO2 using the equation in the pulse ox summary. I added 0.2 to this value as a calibration constant, as my SpO2 reading was typically in the high 0.7s. I added an `if` statement to ensure the SpO2 value didn't go above 1 and had it return 1 if the value was above 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bokeh**\n",
    "\\\n",
    "I followed lesson 16 to displayed streamed plots in Bokeh with buttons for streaming, resetting the data, saving it, and shutting it down. However, I also attempted to add two additional plots: one for displaying the points of the heart rate and the other for the SpO2. I was intending to do this as an additional verification that the pulse rate and SpO2 were being calculated correctly and that the correct peaks were being found. I was able to get two plots to show up for this and to get the x-axis to update for all three plots. However, streaming the data onto the plot proved to be quite difficult. I wrote another Jupyter Notebook where I attempted to do this but spent many hours trying to get it to work without success. I left the plots to show that I did attempt to do this. "

    "To assess the functionality of my pulse ox, there were several factors I was looking at. Firstly, I wanted to ensure that the pulse displaying in the app showed up as clear peaks with little noise. Secondly, I checked to see if the peaks occurred at a reasonable distance from each other. Thirdly, I checked to see if the heart rate and SpO2 readings seemed reasonable. I also checked to see if the heartrate matched the frequency of peaks on the plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before implementing the heartrate and SpO2 to update with the plot, I checked that they were correctly measuring their respective values. This is how I came up with the preset width argument for `scipy.find_peaks()` and the calibration constant for the SpO2. I also counted the number of peaks and calibrated the width argument based on what gave me an accurate number of peaks. I played with this a decent amount and found that for my own pulse, about 1/4 of a second (240 bpm) was a good cutoff to ensure the pulse ox wasn't picking up on the second peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "I spent several hours trying to get the plots of the pulse rate and blood ox to update with the calculated pulse rate and SpO2 data that was being calculated in real time but ended up having multiple errors that were very difficult to figure out. The primary one was being able to update the data at the same time as the other data, while it relied on the other data to be calculated. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the heartrate seems to be consistent with the rate of peaks showing up on the plot and the SpO2 appears to be consistently in the high 90%s, which is consistent with what it should be. I have a relatively fast resting heart rate due to my medications and my pulse ox consistently reads my heart rate in the low 100s, which is close to what it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also tried measuring my pulse (from my neck) while I had the pulse ox on and it seemed to align decently close to the peaks showing up and the rate at which they appeared. Overall, I think that the pulse ox I built and the corresponding app are relatively accurate to my pulse and that it's relatively easy to use."

   "source": [
    "The data my pulse ox collected seems to be fairly accurate and consistent with my actual pulse rate and the pulses detected on the streamed Bokeh plot. I believe that my SpO2 was reading a bit low due to a lack of calibration, which is why I added a calibration constant of 0.25 to the return value and ensured it didn't reach above 100%. In the future, this should be calibrated through a more accurate measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, I tried using the pulse ox while measuring my heart rate through my neck. I got about 96 bpm counting from my neck and the pulse ox read about 103 bpm, which while not 100% accurate, seemed relatively close to me. I've also consistently seen measurements of 99% for my SpO2 after the 0.25 calibration constant, which is consistent with where it should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an earlier version of this code, I played with varying widths for the minimum width argument in `scipy.find_peaks()` until I found a relatively good value that seemed to filter out noise caused by the second peak while still counting each larger first peak as an individual peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, I do not believe that all of these adjustments work perfectly for each person, as I've had slightly less accurate readings for other people using the pulse ox. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can reference the plots above for the pulse readings (these are from the IR AC data). The peaks look relatively clean and are very distinguishable from one another, suggesting that the sample-and-hold circuit, filtering, and amplification were successful. The case was similar for the Red AC data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I think the pulse ox managed to successfully read out slight differences in voltage caused by the movement of blood in the finger. As mentioned previously, the reason why there are two peaks in the data is because there are two cycles of valves opening and closing in the heart for each pump. This results in two slight differences in the movement of blood, which are picked up by the photodiode. When the heart pumps and pushes blood through the body, this causes the finger to absorb more light, resulting in a higher voltage read by the sample-and-hold circuit (as more of a voltage is present after the first resistor).This is read by the IR wavelength of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "The red and IR light can also measure the SpO2 of the blood by measuring the absorption of light in Hb and O2Hb. Blood differs in absorption depending on how oxygenated it is. Thus, through looking at this absorption, through knowing some constants like the extinction coefficients of Hb and O2Hb at these wavelengths, we can determine how much oxygen there is."
