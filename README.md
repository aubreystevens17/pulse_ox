# pulse_ox
Includes an Arduino file paired with a Jupyter notebook to run a pulse ox through an interface


pulse_ox_working.ipynb -  This is a Jupyter notebook that contains an interface to run the pulse ox that communicates with the pulse ox through Arduino. It makes calculations of heart rate and blood oxigination levels based on the input signal.

pulse_ox_working.html - This is a snapshot of the Jupyter notebook working when connected to the pulse oximeter.

pulse_ox_python.ino - This is the Arduino file that communicates with the pulse ox and the Jupyter notebook. It tells the pulse ox to start collecting data and collects it.

pulse_ox_bb.jpg - This is a scematic of the pulse ox I designed and built.

pulse_ox.fzz - This is another file type of the scematic of the pulse ox.
